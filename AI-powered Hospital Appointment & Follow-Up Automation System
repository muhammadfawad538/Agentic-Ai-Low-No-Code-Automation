I’m excited to share a project I recently built: an AI-powered Hospital Appointment & Follow-Up Automation System using n8n and autonomous AI agents.

This system is designed to solve real-world healthcare challenges by fully automating:

✅ Patient appointment booking
✅ Smart WhatsApp/SMS reminders
✅ AI-powered feedback analysis
✅ Automatic urgency detection for critical patient cases

The system uses webhook-based architecture, intelligent routing, and AI-driven decision-making to reduce manual hospital workload and improve patient experience.

What makes this project special is its real-world focus — built with scalability in mind for healthcare digital transformation and enterprise workflow automation.

🔮 What I’m building next for this project:

In the next phase, I plan to add:
• Integration with real hospital management systems (HIS/EMR)
• Predictive AI to anticipate appointment no-shows
• Voice AI agents for patient calling & triage
• Arabic language support for Saudi healthcare use-cases
• Dashboard analytics for hospital staff
